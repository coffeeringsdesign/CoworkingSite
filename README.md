## Description

This project is to build a website for a coworking startup. The first step is to come up with Target Users and User Personas, then reasearch and brainstorm.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository: https://github.com/coffeeringsdesign/CoworkingSite.git_
* _Use Atom to edit html, css & javascript._
* _Sass for a preprocessor._
* _Sketch to view wireframes and prototypes._



## User Profiles

## Research, Inspire, and Brainstorm

#### Step 1 - Other coworking websites

Deskpass | Wework
---------------------- | -----------------------
very nice graphics | very few photos
all needs on one scrolling page | big corporation - too many locations
still has them linked at the top | too corporate!
nice grid gallery showing amenaties | clean but boring
sleek but kind of cold feeling | no colors

TENpod | Collective Agency
---------------------- | -----------------------
clean graphic landing page | not enough whitespace
background images show on mouseover | too much information
grid photos | tl:dr everything
very (too) colorful | not graphic enough
slightly juvenile feeling | eye needs a break

#### Step 2 - Apartment building websites... as a client you want to see where you will be.

Baseline 158 | Indigo @ Twelve West
---------------------- | -----------------------
highlights pictures | great pics that show place
see all the rooms | fixed navigation bar
sticks to two graphic colors | clean but no color
fixed navigation | slow slideshow and animations
two pics with a list of amenities in between | grid gallery
nice flow of info blocks | all on one scolling page

#### Step 2 - How to integrate clients requests with the best, most interesting and most useful aspects of each site that was researched.
* _The first thing the client will see will appear to be a landing page. Good image and intro, but they can scroll down to see all the other information that needs to be presented._

* _While all info will be on the front page (homepage) there will still be a navigation bar fixed at the top to take any visitor (who doesn't scroll) to a simple individual page with that information_

* _There will be two colors to go along with greyscale. This will add brightness and a nice color scheme without seeming overly juvenile._

* _There will be a grid gallery of amenities that will include a description along side in a space in that grid._

* _All information will be quick and easy to read. Not overly busy. Make the eye comfortable._

* _Each key point that they client wants included will get it's own section of the front page. These will be broken apart by color breaks._
